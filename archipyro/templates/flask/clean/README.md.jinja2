## Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Variables
A `.env` file has been generated for you. Review it and update any necessary variables (e.g., Database URL, Secret Key).

## Configuration
The application configuration is managed in `app/config`. You can change the active configuration by setting the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable or by modifying `app/__init__.py`.

Available configurations:
- `development` (default)
- `testing`
- `production`

## Run Application

```bash
flask run
```

{% if "Celery / RQ Background Tasks" in config.features %}
## Celery Worker Setup

This project uses Celery for background tasks. You must have a Redis server running.

### 1. Start Redis Server
Ensure you have Redis installed and running.
```bash
# On Linux/macOS (if installed via package manager)
redis-server
```

### 2. Start Celery Worker
Open a new terminal, activate your virtual environment, and run:
```bash
celery -A app.celery_utils.celery worker --loglevel=info
```
{% endif %}

{% if "Docker" in config.features %}
## Docker Support

You can also run the application using Docker.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
{% endif %}
